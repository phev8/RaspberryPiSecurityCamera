# RaspberryPiSecurityCamera
Take pictures and stream them to dropbox account from the raspberry pi

This repository contians the source and design files for a hobby project to create a security camera with the Raspberry Pi mini computer, which stream the taken picture to your Dropbox account. So you will be able to check the taken pictures easily on the way.
(If you have a server or other options to store the pictures, it could work better, but this is for people who want to minimise the resources.)
